## 🔧 **Deployment Strategy**

- ✅ **Incremental Approach**: Adding improvements one at a time
- ✅ **Local Testing**: Testing each improvement locally before deployment
- ✅ **Live Verification**: Confirming each improvement works in production
- ✅ **Build Verification**: Ensuring each change passes the build process

## 📈 **Progress Toward 98% Target**

- **Current**: 92.4% (Phase 1 baseline)
- **After Improvement 1**: ~93% (estimated)
- **After Improvement 2**: ~93.5% (estimated)
- **Target**: 98%
- **Remaining**: ~4.5% to reach target

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy Improvement 3**: Platform conversion performance handlers
2. **Test and verify** live functionality
3. **Continue incremental improvements** until 98% target is reached
4. **Run full UAT test** after all improvements are deployed

The incremental approach is working well and maintaining deployment stability while adding valuable functionality!
