- **Platform Conversions**: Maintained high performance with existing handlers
- **Overall Stability**: Most categories maintained or improved their performance

### ⚠️ Areas for Phase 3 Focus
- **Comparative Analysis**: Efficiency and performance comparison queries need debugging
- **Specific Metrics**: Still room for improvement to reach 95% target

## 📈 Progress Toward 98% Target

### Current Status: 92.4% (Phase 2)
- **Phase 1**: 92.8%
- **Phase 2**: 92.4%
- **Target**: 98.0%
- **Remaining**: 5.6% to reach target

### Phase 3 Strategy
To reach 98% accuracy, focus on:

1. **Comparative Analysis** (82.5% → 95%): +12.5% potential
   - Debug efficiency comparison handlers
   - Improve "which platform is most efficient" queries
   - Enhance "worst performing" queries

2. **Specific Metrics** (84.4% → 95%): +10.6% potential
   - Fine-tune context detection
   - Improve ambiguous metric queries
   - Add more specific metric handlers

## 🎯 Phase 3 Roadmap

### Priority 1: Fix Comparative Analysis (HIGH)
- Debug why efficiency queries aren't triggering
- Improve pattern matching for comparison queries
- Add fallback handlers for complex comparisons

### Priority 2: Enhance Specific Metrics (HIGH)
- Add more specific metric detection patterns
- Improve context sensitivity for metric queries
- Add handlers for edge cases

### Priority 3: Final Optimization (MEDIUM)
- Fine-tune existing handlers
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Optimize response quality
